### Classes in Typescript
Typescirpt is Object Oriented Programming(OOPs). Its support 
all object-oriented feature like 
* Classes
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Polymorphism

### Class:
Class is an intity that contains method, function
```
class Car {
  name: string;
  modelNumber?: string;
}
```
In the above example, 
an instance of Card is guaranteed to have a **name**, and might optionally have a **modelNumber**.

### Abstract Classes:
Abstract classes are base classes from which other classes may be 
derived. They may not be instantiated directly. An abstract class may contain implementation details for its members. 
The `abstract` keyword is used to define abstract classes as well as abstract methods within an abstract class.
```
abstract class Car { //abstract keyword before the class keyword
    abstract makeHorn(): void; // abstract mathod
    move(): void {
        console.log("car is moving...");
    }
}
```
In above example `makeHorn` marked as `abstract` and do not contain an implementation ans must be implemented in `derived` class.
