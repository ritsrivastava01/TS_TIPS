### Interface
In TypeScript, interfaces fill the role of naming types, and are a powerful way of defining custom type defination. It is a virtual structure
that only exists within the context of TypeScript. Once your code is transpired to its target language, it will be stripped from its interfaces
```
interface Toy { // user 'inerface' keyward  
name: string,
legs?: number // option parameter
}

//Used of interface
class ToyMaker {
  create(toy: Toy) // passed the paramter typed 'Toy'
  {
  return `created toy with name${toy.name}` 
  }
}
```
### Inheritance
Access the parent class property in child class.
```
class Animal {
    move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {
        console.log(`Animal moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);
    }
}
// child class exteneding OR inherit the parent class
class Dog extends Animal { //'Extend' keyword for inheritance
    bark() {
        console.log('Woof! Woof!');
    }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.bark();// called its method
dog.move(10); // called parent method
```
