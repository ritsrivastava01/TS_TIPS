### const:
is mean that the identifier won’t be reassigned.
```
const pi: number = 3.14;
pi = 2.14; // error=> Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```
### let:
is mean that the variable may be reassigned, such as a counter in a loop, or a value swap in an algorithm. It also signals that the variable will be used only in the block it’s defined in, which is not always the entire containing function.
```
let temp:number = 1234;
```
OR
```
let val = 1;
  if(true){
    let val = 2 
  }
console.log(val); // 1 because of variable scope 
```
